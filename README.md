Licensed under **GPLv3**, with a game interoperability permission. See
[LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md) for scope, source-distribution obligations and
[third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Optional threading cooperation requires a provider header with the presentation
dependency contract (`kwthreading_presentation_task_dependencies` and
`KWTHREADING_PRESENTATION_NO_VERTEX_INDEX_ACCESS`). Automatic bundle discovery
falls back to ordinary serial presentation for an older header. Explicit
`WITH_THREADING_INTEGRATION=1` requires the newer contract and reports a build
error if it is unavailable. This does not enable the experimental provider.

Public headers are under `include/kwui/`, for example
`#include <kwui/fast_mainmenu_api.h>`. Shared engine types use `kwengine/`;
loader contracts use `kwf/`.

Rendered UI, chat, menu/list and graphics presentation.

## Layout and build

Production implementation is under `src/`; supported/public or compatibility
headers are under `include/`. Generated files go only to ignored `build/`:
`build/bin` for DLLs/executables, `build/lib` for libraries, `build/obj` for
objects/dependency files, `build/config` for copied configuration templates.

### Linux prerequisites

Use Bash, GNU Make 4.3+, native GCC/G++ (C++17 for bundle staging), and the
32-bit Windows MinGW-w64 toolchain (`i686-w64-mingw32-gcc`,
`i686-w64-mingw32-g++`, `i686-w64-mingw32-ar`).
For Debian/Ubuntu, install `build-essential mingw-w64`. Wine is only needed
to run the game or Windows test executables. No game files are needed to compile.

A checkout of **kw_modloader** is the required SDK dependency. Build it first:

```sh
export KWMOD_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/kw_modloader
make -C "$KWMOD_SDK_ROOT" -j2
```

Then, from this plugin's directory:

```sh
make -j2
make sdk-paths
make bundle
```

For relocated checkouts set `KWMOD_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/kw_modloader`.
It is the only mandatory SDK dependency: generic loader contracts and KW engine support
are both in its `include/` tree. Environment variables and Make arguments work.
`KWMOD_BIN_DIR` and `KWMOD_LIB_DIR` select matching SDK build artifacts;
`sdk-build` builds missing/stale SDK artifacts before linking. Compiler overrides
are `WINDOWS_CC`, `WINDOWS_CXX`, `WINDOWS_AR`; `BUILD_DIR` selects plugin output.

Run `make bundle` (or `make stage`) to assemble `build/bundle/` with this
plugin's DLLs, configuration and manifest in their engine-root-relative layout.
Override `BUNDLE_DIR=/path/to/staging` if needed. This is a plugin overlay,
not a standalone loader installation. Developer variants are not included.
Bundle generation replaces only previously staged, unmodified files and
refuses an unowned or locally edited output directory. Do not point it at an
installed game. See the loader's `docs/BUNDLES.md` for composition details.

Build and staging targets do not install into a game or overwrite user settings.
Use matching loader/SDK artifacts and preserve customized INIs when installing.
Runtime loading uses `.kwplugin` manifests; configuration uses `.ini` files.

### Manual installation

**kw_modloader must be installed for this plugin to load.** With the game closed,
copy the loader's `build/bundle/` contents into the engine directory containing
`cnc3ep1.dat` (normally `RetailExe/1.2`). Then copy this plugin's
`build/bundle/` contents into that same directory, retaining the `plugins/`,
`docs/` and `licenses/` layout. The runtime files are:

```text
RetailExe/1.2/
  dinput8.dll
  kw_runtime.dll
  kw_engine.dll
  plugins/
    kw_ui.dll
    kw_ui.kwplugin
    kw_ui.ini
```

Preserve your customized INI when upgrading; merge new settings from the template.
Check `enabled` in the manifest and restart the game after changing settings.
There is no `make install` target or install-directory variable.
`BUNDLE_DIR` selects a dedicated staging directory, never a live game directory.

The current documented build host is Linux. Compiler overrides are retained for
a future documented native Windows build; that workflow is not yet qualified.

Standalone `make`/`all` is serial and requires no threading headers/repository.
`bundle`/`stage` may compile optional rendering-worker cooperation when the
provider's public header is available; a workspace composition additionally
requires threading to be explicitly selected. Normal composition excludes
threading, so that cooperation stays off. Explicit
`WITH_THREADING_INTEGRATION=0|1 THREADING_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/kw_plugin_threading`
overrides automatic selection. Compiling cooperation does not bundle or enable
the provider; absence at runtime retains serial rendering.
UI configuration is owned by `kwui/config.h` and `src/config.c`.

Menu-title scaling is implemented in `src/hooks/menu_title.inc`, included by
`src/ui_hooks.inc`. This plugin provides UI hooks. The DirectInput entry point
is supplied by `kw_modloader`.
